## {{< fa file-lines >}} Summary

I have been fortunate to work across a range of clinical and research environments that have shaped both my research interests and professional perspective. Through this work, I have gained exposure to diverse clinical conditions, research methodologies, and healthcare practices, and have developed a strong appreciation for how research translates into real-world patient care.

What I find most rewarding is working collaboratively with multidisciplinary teams to bring ideas together and contribute to evidence-based care that can make a meaningful difference for patients.

Below is a summary of my experience, skills, and recognitions so far, which I look forward to continuing to build as my training and career progress.
